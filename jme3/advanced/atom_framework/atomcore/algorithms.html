<div class="paragraph"><p>Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list[1] of well-defined instructions[2] for calculating a function.[3] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[4] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[5] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing “output[6] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[7]</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Linear programming (LP, or linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. More formally, linear programming is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. Its feasible region is a convex polyhedron, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Its objective function is a real-valued affine function defined on this polyhedron. A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polyhedron where this function has the smallest (or largest) value if such a point exists.</p></div>
<div class="sect2"><h3 id="why-use-this-for-games">Why use this &#8230;&#8203; for games?</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>This package provides algorithms common in game developments. More to come but first let&#8217;s take a look of those problems it trying to solve to distingish the objective and goals of this package compare to collection and others.</p></div>
<div class="sect3"><h4 id="it-s-not-another-collection-datastructure-or-pattern-package">It&#8217;s not another Collection (DataStructure) or Pattern package!</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Sort, concurrent, packing, data compressing is also partial relate to its processing method (that&#8217;s algorithm) but first, they are provided as the core of the programming language, second we want to care more about the high level of abstraction, not the details. It use “interface of structure for its explaination and progress.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, pattern is the term refered to a popular method in software developmenet. Pattern is also in higher level of abstraction compare to algorimths. So consider pattern is the law and algorimth is the effective way of making the job work effectively obey that law.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Algorithms involve logic, a lot of them. But it higher level than logic. And of course algorithms need math (some physics, philosophy also) to be smart!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Algorithms are used heavily in AI. But this package only provide pure algorithms which can be used also outside of AI topics.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s said:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Datastructure, Pattern, Logic and AI are supported elsewhere!</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Algorimths depends in Pattern, Logic, Interface of Structure.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div>
<div class="sect3"><h4 id="each-algorithm-has-a-goal-or-several-to-accomplish">Each algorithm has a goal (or several) to accomplish!</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Developer want to use the algorithm they know to solve one or more goals (problem, requirement, aspect, situation, … what ever you call it). The algorithms provided here are the bricks for you to use and reuse, for different purposes. And you may notice the package also be arranged into purposes instead of implementations - techniques or another structure. That&#8217;s explained the reason!</p></div></div>
<div class="sect3"><h4 id="for-games">For games?</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Yes, not all of the problems we know are solved by this library…??? You&#8217;ve already know. It not even sotiphicated like the alternatives below but they are extremely useful for average programmers; especially game programmer, who, usually focus in the fun side (Am I right? :) )</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The library try to provide useful algorithms (best practices and wisdoms) enough for a wide range of usecases and also used in Atom framework its self. The algorimths them self may use another algorimths to solve sub-problems. Of course, it also come with examples and a lot of applications &amp; suggestion, which its the algorithms use for you to quickly and smartly solve your own problem thank to it.
Support algorithms by purposes</p></div>

<div class="sect2"><h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>First of all this package has some degree similar to JScience and Opt4J… I can&#8217;t denied I had used them intensively to know what is good and what is not.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Here i used the term the <strong>saturation of algorithms</strong> to describle the problem from overview.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let say the algorithm A needs B to compute, and than B needs A to compute. The Recursion will be forever in the turing machine such as our computer, until we out of memory or can even cause a crash in some programming language and computer-small scale ones (pc,console…). In real-life, it&#8217;s hardly useful for game developing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In Allocation package, we need to compute the dependencies between resources, si call Dependency package. In computing dependency, we need resource so we call allocation package… This loop is actually fine but its will run forever if there is no saturation point or the end point of the recursion calls.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So in AtomAA, there is a detection of Recursion and cyclic dependency that can break-out early from the infinite loops. Also if Dependency package call, it tell Allocation not to call it again in the amount of time. Allocation then will chose another path of computing by just allocate directly. This not gaurantee to prevent the problem but ease out the percentage you fall into a dead trap. It work pretty much like concurrent contention resolving in by synchronization in Java.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This mean the context of computing is affect the algorithms, lead the algorithm to context-depend. So is it conflict with the definition of algorithm and wrong? Well, in real-life, some algorithms actually work upon a data structure and context, if not to say all of them. The abstraction and agnostic of algorithm is limit but higher than data structure, it just depend in the “context of computing but work in various data structure, even a new one. It&#8217;s also better than normal datastructure in this “loop situation. You may experience the situation that datastructure implementation may cause infinite loop with them self or others. At least algorithms try to prevent that…</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning"><table><tr><td class="icon"><i class="fa icon-warning" title="Warning"></i></td><td class="content"><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Actually when the situation happen, there is a way to stop the whole!… but not a clean way to set a flag, clear the flag and continue again, because the next time, the progress can not distingish between the normal processing and the invalid one. At least not a simple way without Tranactional Memeory Model.</p></div></td></tr></table></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In development mode, with AtomAA , the programmer will be notified and the progress will stop. A monitoring framework can also help. The determistic of the algorithms over arbitrary data (in real-life) is also quite a challange problem. That&#8217;s also a caveat in AtomAA its self.</p></div></div></div>
